**Host:** At exam time it is important to sleep well. Today we have Doctor Baker with us in the studio and he is going to give us five top tips for getting a good night’s sleep. Welcome to the show, Doctor Baker. 

**Dr Baker:** Thank you. It’s great to be here. Let’s start with tip one. Don’t go to bed with the television on. Some people think they can sleep well with the TV on, but the noise and lights mean you don’t really sleep well, so turn it off!

Tip two: Don’t think too much before bedtime. Do your hardest homework earlier in the evening. Do easier homework later. If your brain is too busy and full of ideas it takes longer to get to sleep.

Tip three: Don’t play video games for an hour before you go to sleep. They also make your brain too busy and active. 

Tip four: Turn off your cell phone when you go to bed. What is so important that it can’t wait until the morning? If possible, leave your phone in another room. 

Tip five: Play music if you like. But don’t play it too loud. Turn the sound down low.

**Host:** Thank you, Doctor. That is very useful advice for our young listeners.

**Presentador:** En época de exámenes es importante dormir bien. Hoy tenemos al doctor Baker con nosotros en el estudio y nos va a dar cinco consejos principales para conseguir una buena noche de sueño. Bienvenido al programa, doctor Baker.

**Dr. Baker:** Gracias. Es un placer estar aquí. Empecemos con el primer consejo.  
No te vayas a la cama con el televisor encendido. Algunas personas creen que pueden dormir bien con la televisión prendida, pero el ruido y las luces hacen que en realidad no duermas bien, ¡así que apágala!

**Consejo dos:** No pienses demasiado antes de irte a dormir. Haz las tareas más difíciles más temprano en la noche. Deja las tareas más fáciles para después. Si tu cerebro está demasiado ocupado y lleno de ideas, tardarás más en quedarte dormido.

**Consejo tres:** No juegues videojuegos durante una hora antes de irte a dormir. También hacen que tu cerebro esté demasiado activo.

**Consejo cuatro:** Apaga tu teléfono celular cuando te vayas a la cama. ¿Qué es tan importante que no pueda esperar hasta la mañana? Si es posible, deja tu teléfono en otra habitación.

**Consejo cinco:** Escucha música si te gusta, pero no la pongas demasiado fuerte. Mantén el volumen bajo.

**Presentador:** Gracias, doctor. Es un consejo muy útil para nuestros oyentes jóvenes.

**Charlie:** Mum! That's my computer!

**Mum:** I know, I know. Don't worry, I'm changing your privacy settings.

**Charlie:** Privacy settings?

**Mum:** Yes. There are privacy settings on your social networking sites. Your account is totally public at the moment, and you're logged in!

**Charlie:** Oh. What are the privacy settings for?

**Mum:** To make you safe online. You want to be safe, don't you? And for the right people to see your information, not EVERYONE.

**Charlie:** Everyone?

**Mum:** Yes. If you don't change your privacy settings, when you upload a photo, anyone can see it. It's important to change them so only your friends can see them. You don't want everyone to see everything, do you?

**Charlie:** No! But I can delete things, can't I?

**Mum:** Well, you can, but it's very difficult. Some things stay there forever.

**Charlie:** That's really scary, Mum.

**Mum:** Don't worry, but you must learn how to stay safe. You mustn't tell anyone your password!

**Charlie:** I won't!

**Mum:** Crazy Charlie one two one, isn't it?

**Charlie:** Mum! Yes, it is. How …

**Mum:** It's on your notebook. Right there. On your desk. It isn't a very secret place, is it?

**Charlie:** No, it isn't.
