# Listening Exercise 

> Good morning. My name is Adam. I do many activities during the week. On Monday, I **`usually`** wake up at 7 a.m, I have breakfast with my family and I go to work. **`Sometimes`** on Tuesday, I go to play soccer with my friends. We **`normally`** play at 5 p.m.  
> I have a friend, her name is Kelly. She **`never`** plays soccer, but she plays tennis **`very often`**. On Wednesday I don't have breakfast with my family, because I **`normally`** go to my office at 6 a.m.   
> I **`seldom`** have breakfast with my family, that day. On Thursday I **`frequently`** go to the movies with my family. We **`generally`** don't eat in the house. My children **`always`** eat hot dogs.   
> On Friday, I **`hardly ever`** work. My wife and I **`always`** have breakfast and lunch together, and at night, we **`always`** drink some wine and listen to good music. This is what I do from Monday to Friday.
